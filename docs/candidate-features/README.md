## Configuration Strategy

Each feature includes:

- **Standalone configuration** for independent usage
- **Integration points** with existing features
- **Conditional activation** based on project requirements
- **Environment-specific settings** for development/production
- **Migration scripts** for existing projects

## Selection Criteria

Features can be selected based on:

- **Project type** (e-commerce, SaaS, portfolio, etc.)
- **Team size** and expertise
- **Performance requirements**
- **Security requirements**
- **Target platforms** (web, mobile, desktop)
- **Business requirements** (analytics, internationalization, etc.)

## Form Integration

Each feature integrates with the existing forms system:

- **Feature detection** questions
- **Dependency validation**
- **Configuration prompts**
- **Installation confirmation**
- **Post-installation setup**

## Example Feature Selection Flow

```typescript
interface FeatureSelectionConfig {
  projectType: 'saas' | 'ecommerce' | 'portfolio' | 'cms' | 'other'
  teamSize: 'solo' | 'small' | 'medium' | 'large'
  timeline: 'mvp' | 'production' | 'enterprise'
  platforms: ('web' | 'mobile' | 'desktop')[]
  requirements: {
    authentication: boolean
    payments: boolean
    analytics: boolean
    multiLanguage: boolean
    realTime: boolean
  }
}

// Recommended features based on configuration
const getRecommendedFeatures = (config: FeatureSelectionConfig) => {
  const features: string[] = []

  // Always recommend for production
  if (config.timeline !== 'mvp') {
    features.push('authentication', 'testing', 'devops')
  }

  // E-commerce specific
  if (config.projectType === 'ecommerce') {
    features.push('backend-enhancements', 'security', 'data-analytics')
  }

  // SaaS specific
  if (config.projectType === 'saas') {
    features.push('authentication', 'frontend-enhancements', 'analytics')
  }

  // Mobile requirements
  if (config.platforms.includes('mobile')) {
    features.push('mobile-support')
  }

  return features
}
```

## Getting Started

1. **Review feature documentation** to understand capabilities and requirements
2. **Assess project needs** using the selection criteria
3. **Check dependencies** to ensure proper feature ordering
4. **Configure features** through the interactive forms system
5. **Install incrementally** starting with high-priority features
6. **Test integration** between features as you add them
7. **Customize configuration** for your specific use case

## Contributing

To add new candidate features:

1. Follow the documentation template used by existing features
2. Include implementation details, configuration options, and code examples
3. Define dependencies and integration points
4. Provide installation scripts and setup procedures
5. Add comprehensive package dependencies and version requirements

Each feature should be designed to work independently while integrating seamlessly with the existing scaffolding system and other features.
